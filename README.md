## Made in 8 hours for the Berlin Mini Jam
In this local multiplayer game pachinko meets Jenga: drop your pieces down the board and try to let them touch the pins with the highest value.
But watch out: if your opponent knocks down your pieces you will lose points.

The first one to make it to 60 points wins.

The themes for the jam were "Local Multiplayer" and "That was totally supposed to happen!‚Äù.
